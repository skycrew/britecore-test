Implementation Engineer Hiring Project
======================================

This is a project that we use for testing potential team members on their technical skills.

Feature Request App
-------------------

Build a web application that allows the user to create "feature requests".

A "feature request" is a request for a new feature that will be added onto an existing piece of software. Assume that the user is an employee at IWS who would be entering this information after having some correspondence with the client that is requesting the feature. The necessary fields are:

*   **Title:** A short, descriptive name of the feature request.
*   **Description:** A long description of the feature request.
*   **Client:** A selection list of clients (use "Client A", "Client B", "Client C")
*   **Client Priority:** A numbered priority according to the client (1...n). Client Priority numbers should not repeat for the given client, so if a priority is set on a new feature as "1", then all other feature requests for that client should be reordered.
*   **Target Date:** The date that the client is hoping to have the feature.
*   **Product Area:** A selection list of product areas (use 'Policies', 'Billing', 'Claims', 'Reports')

Tech Stack Requirements
-----------------------

The following are requirements on the tech stack. This stack demonstrates mastery of tools our team favors.

*   OS: Ubuntu
*   Server Side Scripting: Python 2.7+ or 3.6+
*   Server Framework: Flask, web.py, or SimpleHTTPServer
*   ORM: Sql-Alchemy
*   JavaScript: JQuery and/or KnockoutJS

Guidelines
----------

Build your own public repo on github, and call it whatever you like. Build your solution in your repo, and include a README.md file that contains the detailed instructions for running your web app.

One of the major goals in this project is to see how you fill in ambiguities in your own creative way. There is no such thing as a perfect project here, just interpretations of the instructions above, so be creative in your approach.

We want to be respectful of your time and set realistic expectations for submission. To help guide you, we have included a deliverables and evaluation section which details common practices in the best projects we receive.

Deliverables
------------

In order to move your application forward, deliverables will include:

1.  A deployed version of your project running on Ubuntu
    
2.  A GitHub repo containing your project. Your repo must contain these three things:
    
    *   A README that explains your approach and deployment method
    *   Your code solution to this test
    *   The Python file called `quiz.py` that you used to solve the debugging quiz
3.  Adding of these items to your resume's cover letter:
    
    *   The link to the GitHub repo that lists this project
    *   The link to the deployed version of your project
4.  Uploading of your resume with cover letter in PDF or DOCX format by [clicking this link](https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/britecorecom/view/P_AAAAAAEAADyJB4SlEI1Km_)
